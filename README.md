# Know Your Health

### Because Only Your Health Remains with You

## The problem Know Your Health solves

We all know that "A healthy mind lives in a healthy body", "Health is Wealth" and many similar quotes but not many among us give it that much importance and time. We are having our health going down the lane day by day. A major reason for our decreasing health is our lifestyle and environment.
So to understand what are the factors due to which we are having a lot of health issues, I created this Dapp. It is an anonymous Survey application where the identity of the user is protected. We are not taking any information that might go against the privacy of users. The data collected from this app can be used to train many more ML models efficiently.
This Dapp will also give graphical results to the data stored and we can see how many people are suffering from similar issues and might develop diseases after living in this environment.

## Challenges I ran into

Tezos Blockchain was quite a new thing for me to work with. So it took me a lot of time on how to write a smart contract in SmartPy. Also considering the test cases for testing it on the test network gave me a lot of errors and I had to debug the code due to some parsing issues. I didn't know how to make a connection between the frontend and the backend and transfer data among the ends. It was quite a tricky part to understand. But the workshops played an extremely important role during the whole event where I was able to find the answers to a lot of questions.
